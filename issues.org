* DONE [REWORK] Change the ways deck stack works
  CLOSED: [2021-11-07 Sun 13:21]
  Right now you can either specify a deck that an element leads to, or leave it blank in which case the stack pops. Blank is the default.
  It would make more sense if the default was "just remain in current deck", and there was another setting called "return" that caused the stack to pop.  

So the difference would be, stack would only be popped when the next deck is the "return" type.

* TODO [BUG] Fix arithmethic 
Note: would be useful to see whats broken about arithmethic.
* TODO [BUG] Fix early action at beggining of game not outputting it's display
* TODO [REWORK] Make it possible to quote things easily
So, here are the possible situations:
- "thing beginning in quotes"

* DONE [BUG] Fix parsing of sentences
  CLOSED: [2021-09-14 Tue 17:58]
* TODO [FEATURE] Implement negation
* TODO [BUG] Fix parser glitches appearing sometimes near variables
* TODO [BUG] Fix bug with weaving
To reproduce: check the interactive kiosk weave, one of the non-first options
* TODO [FEATURE] Implement an easier way to return from completed weaves automatically
  Perhaps it would have been sufficient to deploy it when a weave deck does not have any early actions.
* TODO [FEATURE] Implement an easier way to make sure you can't pick same choice twice
* TODO [REWORK] See about getting rid of available when section at all and just use special syntax for dynamic database terms
Note: that would require logical negation first, since I am using "not" a lot.
But overal this would be obviously the correct choice.
* TODO [REWORK] Make "once" attribute on actions true by default
I have no idea why its not that way already!
* TODO [REWORK] Make the syntax consistent (as measured by the ability to memorize it without needing to look it up constantly)
It should be systematic, in the way that whenever you ask yourself the question "did I do it that way, or the other?" I should just reason myself the answer from the first-ish principles.

This probably includes giving everything consistent names. 
* TODO [FEATURE] Allow importing/including other files
Probably not /that/ difficult to implement, and I will need it sooner or later.
