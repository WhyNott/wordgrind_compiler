#note to self:
# If I want multiple choices with the same name (and I do want that sometimes) I will need to represent them as a list rather than an object. It makes more sense that way, too.
#Actually, this causes a lot of problems. I will need to rethink this approach.
#Can I have an early action happen before the game starts.

Self-examination:
  Weave:
    - '>Examine yourself'
    - You feel pretty bad. You are so weak that if it wasn't for your splitting headache you would go straight to sleep.
    - '>Try going to sleep anyway':
        - You toss an turn and lay down for a few minutes, but it's pointless. The heat of your body, and the shard of pain in your skull, are unbearable. Besides, its already past dawn, and you forgot to roll down your blinds.
        # ᐳ ＂
        - '> Cover your windows and get back to sleep':
            - Nice try, but by the time you had made it out of bed and halfway across your room, you realize it doesn't matter anymore. You have gotten up.
        - '> No, seriously, get up to find painkillers'
         
    - '> Get up to find painkillers'
    - ＂Ugh, not again...＂ you think to yourself.

    - Either way, there should be some Ibuprofen in your kitchen.
